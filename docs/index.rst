Welcome to Text Machine Lab wiki!
==================================================

This is a Text Machine Lab wiki.
If you are a new member, start with our `Welcome Guide <https://text-machine-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html>`_ and `Useful Staff <https://text-machine-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/useful_stuff.html>`_ pages.

Hopefully, all information about servers setup, student guides, FAQ (how to update CUDA, etc.) will be placed here.
Please, **use it**, edit it and write it. We do need a common place to share structured info. Look to a (really short) `usage <https://text-machine-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ section for a quick start.
If you searched for something here and did not find it, it would be nice to add this information later, after you found it elsewhere (if you needed it, probably somebody else will need it too).

To add/update this wiki, simply push `Edit on GitHub` button in the top-right corner. You have to be a part of `github.com/text-machine-lab <https://github.com/text-machine-lab/>`_ in order to push directly into the master branch, and this is a recommended way to do it. The website is automatically updated after a push to the repository, so you don't need to do anything else (just to wait about a minute or so). More can be found in the `Usage` section.

Recommendations:

* *Bad article is better than no article.*
* Keep wiki structure as flat as possible.
* Use markdown syntax to make your post better formatted.
* Grammarly is an excellent resource to check your writing before submission
