# PhD graduation

Decided to graduate? Welcome to hell.

Congratulations on making it this far. However, you are not quite there yet - there is still an overwhelming amount of paperwork you will have to go through.
To save yourself some time, please follow this step-by-step guideline on how to get graduation clearance.

Note that if you are reading this wiki, it is assumed that you've already got a full-time job offer. If you haven't yet, prep for the interviews and come back here once you do get an offer.

## 1. OPT application
Depending on your job start date, your first step is to clarify the date of the end of the program. 
You are allowed to apply for OPT 90 days prior to the end of your program, and it is *strongly* recommended you use all of that period and apply on time.

**Remember that without physically getting an EAC you are not allowed to start your job and receive any financial benefits.**
